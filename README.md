# AmigaMultiROM_LP
This is a 4 way Amiga ROM switcher built using a low profile solution. Tested on the Amiga 600.
Built in a similar fashion to the BeeMultiROM (https://ilike8bits.com/2022/08/10/assembling-the-microbee-multirom/). Drop in turned pins. Solder them in using a turned pin socket to keep everything aligned.
Once consrtucted, just the pins off the two turned pins closest to the connector and insulate. (I used nail polish)
There are 3 data pins to select from 4 ROMs and a common.
